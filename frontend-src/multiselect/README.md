The multiselect code in this folder is copied from https://github.com/mneofit/multiselect
That multiselect library is authored by Mikhail Neofitov. The code is copied here because that library is not published on npm.
Since the library does not have regular releases, I (Philip) am not concerned about pinning ourselves to this snapshot of the code. If we want changes, we probably just fork the original project (and try to make pull requests to contribute upstream).
